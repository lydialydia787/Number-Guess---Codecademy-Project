# Number-Guesser
This was a project I completed while learning JavaScript. The JavaScript code is what I did, the rest was given by CodeCademy as a formatting. 
This game is where you guess a number and a computer guesses a number. There will be an original number and whoever guesses the number or whoever's guess is closer wins ! It counts up with each round and keeps track of wins for either person or computer.
